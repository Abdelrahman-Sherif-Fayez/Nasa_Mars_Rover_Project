# Nasa Rover Project
This project is modeled after the NASA Sample Return Robot Challenge and we can get experience with the three essential elements of robotics, which are perception, decision making and actuation. We will carry out this project in a simulator environment built with the Unity game engine.

## 1.Traning Mode
We can test the simulator using "Traning Mode" by using Keyboard and Mouse


## 2.Autonomous mode
To navigate autonomously we have to call drive_rover.py. We have to complete perception.py and decision.py.

## 3.Data Analysis
Included in Jupyter Notebook to perform various steps of the project
